        <h2>Tips and Notes</h2>
        <p>
            For extra fluffy pancakes, let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking. This allows the baking
            powder to activate properly. You can also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the wet ingredients for extra
            flavor.
